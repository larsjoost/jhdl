# jhdl

The software is under development and cannot be used yet.

The aim of the project is to make a series of very fast HDL tools supporting VHDL and Verilog. The tools will be:

* VHDL and Verilog syntax checker

* VHDL and Verilog analyser

* VHDL and Verilog compiling and conversion to SystemC

* SystemC simulator

VHDL and Verilog formatted filename dependency list. Could be used to generate file lists for synthesis tools or tar tool.

The code is written for maintainability and should be easily expandable since it uses the visitor pattern.

Regression tests are located in testsuite directory.
